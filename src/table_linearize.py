"""
Linearize annex table rows into self-contained sentences.

Why:
    A 4B model cannot reliably extract atomic facts from a flat
    "L-lysine 2b04 5 mg/kg poultry" string — it has no anchor for
    the column semantics. Re-attaching column headers as a sentence
    template restores that context.

Output unit:
    LinearizedRow = (sentence, table_locator_template)

The downstream extractor receives `sentence` as the LLM input, and
upon producing each fact, attaches the matching `TableLocator` (with
`col_indices` filled in based on which columns the fact references).
